## Why Syndeo was born?

![Logo Syndeo](ImagenesRepo/imagenesLogoSyndeo/LOGO%20AZUL.svg)


SYNDEO was part of our Information System Engineering Thesis (Proyecto Final de Grado in spanish) at the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional - U.T.N. (in english: National Technological University), in Villa Mar√≠a, C√≥rdoba, Argentina.

### About US

DreamTeam‚Ñ¢ (our team name) was born in 2017 in the interior of C√≥rdoba, more precisely in the town of Villa Mar√≠a. This team was maintained throughout our passage through the U.T.N.

Reaching the end of this cycle, and to put a brooch at the height of our passage through this house of studies, is why Syndeo is born.
SYNDEO was developed by:

- P√©rtile, Franco Giuliano
- Rotondaro, Lucas Daniel
- Brambilla, Roman Dar√≠o

![Integrantes](ImagenesRepo/Integrantes.png)

SYNDEO consists of two part:
- The application itself. (This repository)
- Project Management Document. You can find the PDF in this repo as well, or clicking [Here!](ImagenesRepo\Thesis.pdf)

Disclaimer: *Since the project took place in an argentinean university, the whole project is in spanish*

The project managemt document is based in the PMBOK.

### What is PMBOK?

The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) is a set of standard terminology and guidelines (a body of knowledge) for project management. The body of knowledge evolves over time and is presented in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (the Guide to the PMBOK or the Guide), a book whose sixth edition was released in 2017. The Guide is a document resulting from work overseen by the Project Management Institute (PMI), which offers the CAPM and PMP certifications.

Much of the PMBOK Guide is unique to project management such as critical path method and work breakdown structure (WBS). The PMBOK Guide also overlaps with general management regarding planning, organising, staffing, executing and controlling the operations of an organisation. Other management disciplines which overlap with the PMBOK Guide include financial forecasting, organisational behaviour, management science, budgeting and other planning methods.

### We decided to open source SYNDEO

<br>

During our career, the project was developed in a private repository, and now that we finished our careers, we decided to open source our project, so everyone can see our work, since one of SYNDEO's goal is to:

<div style="font-size:35px" align="center">Enjoy a pleasant and uninterrupted reading experience.</div>

Where it doesn't matter if you are reading an spanish book, russian, or english, as long as you enjoy the reading experience ü§óüìñ.

In our private repository, we have a better environment, but we decided to leave the most essential to a have a quick setup for new outcomers.

## Execute in your editor

Use the package manager [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to install all the requirements.

Steps:
1. Install dependencies
```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

2. Apply migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
3. Create a Language and Account
   
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
```py
from base.models import Idioma, Account
nuevo_idioma= Idioma(name="Ingl√©s")
nuevo_idioma.save() 
nuevo_idioma= Idioma(name="Espa√±ol")
nuevo_idioma.save() 
super_user = Account(is_admin=True,is_staff=True,is_superuser=True,is_active=True,first_name="syndeo",email="syndeo@email.com",password="123456")
super_user.save()
```
4. Add a valid password for your superuser

```bash
python manage.py changepassword syndeo@email.com
#Follow the django instructions
```
5. Run it!
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### *Add support for more languages:*
This project uses the IBM Watson API, to translate and generate the audio.
![Ibm Watson](ImagenesRepo\IBMwatsonLogo.png)

With and empty database, the app does not know witch languages are available, feel free to add the following with the Django Admin:

The following are the languages that were tested by us, but the API supports up to +40 languages.

Note: <em> Add them in spanish, not in english, for instance,add **Ruso** and not **Russian** </em>

- Ruso (Russian)
- Alem√°n (German)
- Italiano (Italian)
- Holand√©s (Dutch)
- Ingl√©s (English)
- Espa√±ol (Spanish)
- Franc√©s (French)
- Portugues (Portuguese)

How it should look like in your admin panel:

![Django Admin Panel Idiomas](ImagenesRepo\DjangoAdmin.png)

### Change the API Keys with yours

This application uses three API keys:

- IBM Watson: For the translation and audio generation.
  - The variable that contains the apikey is in the `texto_views.py` file, and the variable name is `apikey`, replace it with yours, otherwise, you won't get the translation nor audio generation.
- Amazon Web Services S3: for store the images and audio in production, although, this is not necessary, because that funtionality is commented, and the application uses PostgreSQL by default. 
  - Feel free to change it in `setting.py`, the variable name are `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and uncomment them as well.
- Gmail Account: the application uses a Gmail account to activate/restore accounts and password, so if you want to have these functions, add an valid/active gmail account, in `setting.py`, and the variables name are `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, otherwise, you will have to active your account manually through the django admin panel, or remove these functions.


### Run backend and frontend separately
If you want to run or edit the frontend with react, you can do the following
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Then if you want build the frontend, and to be reflected in django, you have to enter the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm build
```

Now you'll
